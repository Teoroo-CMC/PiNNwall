# PiNNwall

PiNNwall enables the integration of a machine learned charge response kernel (CRK) predicted by PiNN[^1] with the Metalwalls MD simulation software[^2]. PiNNwall was first introduced in the following work[^3], and later upgraded through the introduction of higher-order tensorial features in PiNN[^4]. A more in-depth tutorial illustrating the application of PiNNwall to a hydroxylated electrode can be found in the *examples* part of the documentation.
